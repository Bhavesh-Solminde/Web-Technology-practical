# Web-Technology-practical

Practice repository for Web Technology experiments completed as part of the 2025-26 lab cycle.

## Experiments

1. **Exp_1** – Demonstrates fundamental HTML elements (text styles, lists, tables, media, and form controls).
2. **Exp_2** – Responsive landing page for a fictional invoicing tool built with semantic markup and a modern typography system.
3. **Exp_3** – CSS grid photo gallery with interactive lightbox behavior powered by a small vanilla JavaScript module.

## Viewing the labs

Open the desired file in a browser (e.g., `Exp_1/Exp_1.html`, `Exp_2/index.html`, or `Exp_3/index.html`). The CSS and JS files live alongside each experiment.
